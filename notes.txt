Notes:
- Could really do with a way to test a whole game with just one command. Manually starting the clients and doing the connections each time is REALLY slow

Fixed a lot of stuff last time

Known issues:
- Final move of the game is not transmitted to the observers

Todo:
- Fill in squares on observers
- Only draw last line of each player in colour, all else dark grey
- Clean everything up

- ONLY AFTER THE ABOVE IS DONE
- Add the move time restrictions
- Make it much easier to run tests/dev
