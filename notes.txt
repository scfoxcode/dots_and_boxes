Made some progress:
- Fixed bad reference error in encodingk, we were nuking the function prototypes off original state
- Back and forth comms seem to be working. Random move is chosen and correctly submitted

Bugs:
- Player 2 is never asked for a move, we must not be toggling between somewhere
- Player 1 played an illegal move somewhere, or the detection is wrong

                        errors.push(new Error(`${Errors.ILLEGALMOVE} - Line already played x: ${move.x} y: ${move.y} ${directionKey} for player: ${player}`));
                                                                                                                                                   
ReferenceError: player is not defined
    at IsMoveLegal (file:///E:/coding/projects/personal/dots_and_boxes/shared/gamestate.js:155:127)

Fix reference error in the above. Continue debugging.


Notes:
- Could really do with a way to test a whole game with just one command. Manually starting the clients and doing the connections each time is REALLY slow
