Notes:
- Could really do with a way to test a whole game with just one command. Manually starting the clients and doing the connections each time is REALLY slow

Fixed a lot of stuff last time

Known issues:
- Final move of the game is not transmitted to the observers - FIXED

Todo:
- Fill in squares on observers - COMPLETED
- Only draw last line of each player in colour, all else dark grey - COMPLETED
- Clean everything up - COMPLETED

- ONLY AFTER THE ABOVE IS DONE
- Add the move time restrictions - TODO
- Make it much easier to run tests/dev - TODO
- Add extra game modes, screensaver and solo, quality of life change - TODO
